# Chocolate-Doom-Launcher
A simple GUI Launch Menu written in batch for Chocolate Doom

# Problem Solved
If you launch Chocolate Doom it will default to Doom2. This becomes a bit of an annoying problem after awhile. The work around to this is to use command line to launch the games. I choose to make it much simpler and made a small, spartan-ish menu to launch the game of your choice with two luxury features of being able to warp to a given mission and episode in Doom and DoomII and to check out John Romero's version of E1M8. 

# Overview
Chocolate Doom is a source port that accurately reproduces the experience of Doom. It's source code can be found here:https://github.com/fragglet/chocolate-doom or you can download a copy here:https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Downloads. The WADs for Doom can be purchased from Steam and then added to the directory of Chocolate Doom. Steams current DOS Box is not very useful for playing Doom. If you get the Doom Classic Complete Collection you will have the ability to use options 1-4 and 6. To use 5 you will need to download John Romero's version of E1M8 level from his drop box here:https://www.dropbox.com/s/2x2ee3r51986dkt/e1m8b.zip and place it in the Chocolate Doom directory. The batch file should be useable if the other WADs are not available. Of course, written in batch this will only work on Windows Computer. Have fun and enjoy improving and modding it.
